wukong!'s documentation
===================================

this is where you will be able to find a list to all of wukong!'s commands, it is still very basic because it is my first time messing around with documentation like this using sphinx and readthedocs

you can invite wukong! to your server by clicking here_ if you haven't yet.

you can also join the `support server`_ if you have any other question.

wukong! is open-source, so feel free to check out the code at the `github repository`_
